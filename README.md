# Magritte
A hand-gesture–driven audio control system. The selected track is separated into three stems — Vocal, Beat(bass and drums), and Chords (chord-based backing) — enabling independent control of each layer.

Volume: pinch gesture with vertical movement. 

Seek forward/backward: right-hand wrist-twist with thumb and little finger extended. 

Previous/next track: right-hand horizontal movement. 

Play/Pause: right-hand fist/open.
